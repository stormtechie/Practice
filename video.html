<!--The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes.

If height and width are not set, the browser does not know the size of the video. The effect will be that the page will change (or flicker) while the video loads.

Text between the <video> and </video> tags will only display in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

Multiple <source> elements can link to different video files. The browser will use the first recognized format.
Your browser does not support the video tag. To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute:-->
</video>
<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
